## üîç HOW TO FIND SELECTORS:

1. **Right-click on any form field**
2. **Click "Inspect Element"**  
3. **Look in the HTML code for:**
   - `name="title"` ‚Üí Use selector: `title`, type: `name`
   - `id="description"` ‚Üí Use selector: `description`, type: `id`
   - Button text "Save" ‚Üí Use selector: `Save`, type: `text`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è COMMON MISTAKES:
- ‚ùå Don't use file names like "84.73 KB"
- ‚ùå Don't use folder names like "My Drive"  
- ‚ùå Don't use file URLs
- ‚úÖ Only use HTML form field attributes

## üöÄ GUARANTEED SUCCESS:
1. Use the simple test data first
2. Test on httpbin.org/forms/post
3. Once that works, find real KDP selectors
4. The extension WILL work!

**The extension is working - you just need the right data!** üéØ
