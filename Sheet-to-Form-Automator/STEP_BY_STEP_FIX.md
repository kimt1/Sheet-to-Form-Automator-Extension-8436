# üî• STEP-BY-STEP FIX - DO THIS NOW!

## üö® YOUR PROBLEM:
You're using **Google Drive file data** instead of **HTML form selectors**!

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION (5 MINUTES):

### STEP 1: Clean Your Sheet
1. Open your Google Sheet
2. **DELETE ALL DATA** (select all and delete)
3. **Start fresh**

### STEP 2: Add Headers
Type these EXACT headers in row 1:
```
FieldName | Selector | SelectorType | Value | Trigger
```

### STEP 3: Add Test Data
Copy this EXACTLY into your sheet:

```
Book Title | title | name | My Amazing Book | NORMAL
Description | description | id | This is my book description | SLOW
Save Button | Save | text | CLICK | SLOW
```

### STEP 4: Test on Simple Site First
1. Go to: https://httpbin.org/forms/post
2. Change your data to:

```
Customer Name | custname | name | John Doe | FAST
Phone | custtel | name | 555-1234 | FAST
Email | custemail | name | test@email.com | FAST
Submit Button | Submit | text | CLICK | SLOW
```

### STEP 5: Run Extension
1. Make sure sheet is public
2. Configure extension with sheet URL
3. Go to the test form
4. Click "Fill This Form"
5. **IT WILL WORK!**

### STEP 6: Find Real KDP Selectors
Once test works, find KDP selectors:
1. Go to KDP form
2. **Right-click on title field** ‚Üí Inspect
3. Look for: `<input name="title">`
4. Use: selector=`title`, type=`name`

## üéØ WHY IT FAILED BEFORE:
- ‚ùå "84.73 KB" is not a form field selector
- ‚ùå "My Drive" is not a selector type
- ‚ùå You were using file browser data, not form data

## ‚úÖ WHAT WORKS:
- ‚úÖ `title` (actual HTML input name)
- ‚úÖ `name` (how to find it)
- ‚úÖ `My Book Title` (what to type)

**DO THIS NOW AND IT WILL WORK!** üöÄ
